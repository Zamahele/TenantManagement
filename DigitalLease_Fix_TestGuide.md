# Digital Lease Issue Fix - Testing Guide

## Issue Summary
- **Problem**: Lease status shows "Awaiting Signature" but `GeneratedHtmlContent` is null
- **Cause**: Lease was manually set to `Sent` status without proper digital content generation
- **Solution**: Enhanced error handling and repair functionality

## Testing Steps

### For Tenants:
1. **Test the Profile Cards:**
   - Go to Tenant Profile ? My Leases tab
   - Click on "Preview Documents" card
   - **Expected Result**: Should now show helpful error message explaining the issue

2. **Test Enhanced Error Messages:**
   - The system will now display:
     - ? "Your lease is marked as ready for signing, but the document content is missing"
     - ?? "This appears to be a data issue. Please contact your property manager"
     - ?? Technical note with lease ID for reference

3. **Test Status Info:**
   - Go to: `/DigitalLease/LeaseStatusInfo?leaseAgreementId=YOUR_LEASE_ID`
   - **Expected Result**: Detailed status information and data integrity warnings

### For Managers:
