# ?? **TESTING GUIDE: Professional Lease Template & Browser Detection Fix**

## ? **What's Been Fixed:**

### **1. Browser Detection Enhanced:**
- ? **Microsoft Edge**: Now properly detected as "Microsoft Edge"
- ? **Google Chrome**: Shows as "Google Chrome" 
- ? **Other Browsers**: Mozilla Firefox, Safari, Opera properly identified
- ? **Priority Logic**: Edge detected first (since it contains "Chrome" in user agent)

### **2. Compilation Fixed:**
- ? **Syntax Error**: Fixed "Company's Email" ? "CompanyEmail"  
- ? **Build Status**: ? **SUCCESSFUL**

## ?? **Why You're Seeing Old Format:**

Your test lease (ID 18) shows:
```
Browser: Chrome  ? (Should be "Microsoft Edge")
?? Signature image not available  ? (Should show actual signature)
```

**Root Cause:** Lease 18 was generated with the **old template** before our professional upgrade.
